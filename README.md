## What is Discord WHOIS?
Discord WHOIS is a Discord bot aiming to provide simple user/guild lookup.

## What can it do?
Discord WHOIS tracks a lot of user information allowing you to see the following:

- Latest message
- Message count
- Known guilds
- Guilds they are staff on
- And a **lot, lot more**!

## Can I see my data?
We always value your privacy and while we try to give your data to you, it's impossible to have the bot extract all of it.
If you want your data, please DM **@BadBoyHaloCat#1826** on Discord.

## How does it work?
The way Discord WHOIS works, is by tracking user stats in many guilds. When you send a message, around 5 values are modified on YOU, and about 10 are modified on the guild.
When you run a WHOIS, we check for all of this user data and send it to you.

## Is my data backed up?
To prevent accidental data loss, the bot will automatically back up the database every once in a while.

## How can I contribute?
Just make a new branch here on GitHub and then simply make your changes and then open a pull request.
